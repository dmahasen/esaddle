\title{Empirical cumulant generating function}
\usage{
ecgf(lambda, X, grad = 0, mix = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{lambda}{Point at which the CGF is evaluated (d-dimensional vector).}

\item{X}{(n by d) matrix containing the data.}

\item{grad}{If grad == 0 only the value of the CGF is returned, 
if grad == 1 also its first derivative wrt lambda 
and if grad == 2 also the second derivarive wrt lambda.}

\item{mix}{Mixture of empirical and normal CGF to use (if 1 only empirical CGF is used).
Default value is 0.9.}
}
\value{
A list with entries:
        \itemize{
        \item{ \code{K} }{The value of the empirical CGF at lambda;}
        \item{ \code{dK} }{The value of the gradient empirical CGF wrt lambda at lambda;}
        \item{ \code{d2K} }{The value of the hessian of the empirical CGF wrt lambda at lambda;}
        }
}
\description{
Calculates the empirical cumulant generating function (CGF) and its derivatives
              given a sample of n d-dimentional vectors
}
\examples{
X <- matrix(rnorm(2 * 1e3), 1e3, 2)
ecgf(lambda = c(0, 0), X = X)
